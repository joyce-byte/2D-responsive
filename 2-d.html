            I can see the clouds are thinning now, like a fading foggy morning on a cruise ship bow
Like a hoard of starving natives as they die of wanting something for to eat somehow
Like the softest cotton shirt fresh from the dryer on a February afternoon
Becoming ever more transparent as you wash it and you wear it, then it's gone too soon
Either I am getting taller or the ground is growing smaller, or I'm much too high
Blue skies overhead, have me convinced that total ecstasy is found right here in the sky
The universe is out there with its leases and its timeshares in the void of space
The earthly crust below has lost its texture and its flow as has this human race
Either I am getting taller or the ground is growing smaller, or I'm much too high
Blue skies overhead, have me convinced that total ecstasy is found right here in the sky
The universe is out there with its leases and its timeshares in the void of space
The earthly crust below has lost its texture and its flow as has this human race
Biding time till clouds are gone and I can write another song that steals a lover's heart
My head is ten times clearer than it was when all that beer just blew my thoughts apart
A dollar or a dime, an ode a nursery rhyme, somehow, I can't be sure
Whether all this introspection is a vaccine or an injection, or a magic cure
Either I am getting taller or the ground is growing smaller, or I'm much too high
Blue skies overhead, have me convinced that total ecstasy is found right here in the sky
The universe is out there with its leases and its timeshares in the void of space
The earthly crust below has lost its texture and its flow as has this human race
I can finally see for miles, down subway tunnels, grocery aisles; across the barren plain
But no matter where I'm gazing, all these human cattle grazing seem to look the same
Fathers, mothers, sons, and daughters
They're all headed for the slaughter, yet they have no clue
They assemble, congregate, put on airs and put on weight until their lives are through
Either I am getting taller or the ground is growing smaller, or I'm much too high
Blue skies overhead, have me convinced that total ecstasy is found right here in the sky
The universe is out there with its leases and its timeshares in the void of space
The earthly crust below has lost its texture and its flow as has this human race
I keep trying to look past it, but it's like an Easter basket full of chocolate fruit
Distracting like a sunny, sultry, scented playboy bunny in a birthday suit
I dare not chance a nibble; troubles multiply like tribbles if you let one in
So, I leap that tasty treat in my reclining ejector seat unscathed, unmarked by sin
Either I am getting taller or the ground is growing smaller, or I'm much too high
Blue skies overhead, have me convinced that total ecstasy is found right here in the sky
The universe is out there with its leases and its timeshares in the void of space
The earthly crust below has lost its texture and its flow as has this human race
This tale is nearly through; my mind goes blank; no more to stew in existential fear
The enemy is hate; I can't stumble, stray or wait; I must be straight and clear
I can still see the horizon and the beauty of your eyes in every newborn day
So, I press on in my journey like someone who had to learn he's simply wired this way
Either I am getting taller or the ground is growing smaller, or I'm much too high
Blue skies overhead, have me convinced that total ecstasy is found right here in the sky
The universe is out there with its leases and its timeshares in the void of space
The earthly crust below has lost its texture and its flow as has this human race
Soft green carpet spreads below me, although no one really knows me
I feel soft and sure
Unadulterated pondering, trite poetic wandering, despised and pure
As euphoria descends, the earth gets closer and it sends me down from high above
There is so much more to know; feet on the ground
It's time to grow an even deeper love
Either I am getting taller or the ground is growing smaller, or I'm much too high
Blue skies overhead, have me convinced that total ecstasy is found right here in the sky
The universe is out there with its leases and its timeshares in the void of space
The earthly crust below has lost its texture and its flow as has this human race
So, kiss goodbye the present tenses
Sunburned black wrought iron fences that keep out the good
Yes, the aftermath is scary but still plausible; less hairy if you'll lose the hood
Live life well and while you live it, somehow still forgive it as you drown in strife
You can bang the funeral gong, but the world's longest song plays on long past your life
